  "free_q_1": "Patient presents with chronic emotional dysregulation, rapid mood cycling (3-4 times daily), severe irritability, and academic decline. Despite compliance with therapy, patient exhibits impulsivity and aggression. Sleep is erratic with periods of 2-3 hours per night without reported fatigue. Symptoms have been resistant to standard anxiety and depression protocols.",
  "free_q_2": "Differential diagnosis includes Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), and ADHD Combined Type (F90.2).",
  "free_q_3": "Diagnosis is complicated by overlapping symptom profiles. High energy and distractibility mimic ADHD, but the cyclical nature suggests a mood disorder. Previous trials of stimulants resulted in increased agitation and paranoia, while SSRIs triggered manic-like activation (rapid speech, flight of ideas), making a definitive diagnosis based solely on clinical interview impossible.",
  "free_q_4": "1. Is the cognitive profile consistent with ADHD or are attention deficits secondary to a mood disorder? 2. Is there evidence of a formal thought disorder or psychosis? 3. Does the personality profile support a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder vs. DMDD to guide medication management?",

  "free_q_7": "Results will determine if a mood stabilizer (e.g., Lamotrigine/Lithium) is medically necessary versus returning to stimulant classes. If testing confirms Bipolar pathology, we will discontinue antidepressant trials which may be exacerbating the condition. Specific cognitive deficits identified will inform IEP accommodations at school."
